Minimal canvas-driven snow field prototype with deterministic world time pausing during zoom.

## Run locally

Use any static file server and open the site in a browser:

```sh
npx serve .
```

Or with Python:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 (or the served port).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository using the `main` branch (or `gh-pages`).
3. The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` once Pages finishes building.
